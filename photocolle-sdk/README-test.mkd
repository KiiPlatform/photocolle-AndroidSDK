## Setting files.

To execute PhotoColle SDK test cases, you need to put a setting file
named auth.json in the directory ```/sdcard/photocolle-test/setting```
of your device or emulator.

The example of the auth.json is followings:

```json
{
    "consumerKey" : "YOUR CONSUMER KEY",
    "consumerSecret" : "YOUR CONSUMER SECRET",
    "accessToken" : "YOUR ACCESS TOKEN",
    "tokenSecret" : "YOUR TOKEN SECRET"
}
```

## Data files

Before you start test, you need to copy files in testdata directory to
a directory ```/sdcard/photocolle-test/data``` of your device or emulator.

## Changing URL

If you want to change server URL, you need to put
photocolle_sdk_setting.json to assets directory.

## Executing test on command line.

You can execute test on command line with gradle command. Tasks of gradle
command were followings:

  * unitTest : executing unit tests.
  * integrityTest : executing integrity tests.
  * allTest : executing unit tests and integrity tests.

Test results are placed under junit-results directory.

Example of executing tests on command line is following:

```sh
gradlew unitTest
```
